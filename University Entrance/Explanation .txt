For the Greek univercity entrance exams the test is graded from two graders. 
If both of the graders differance is less than 2 the final grade is the average of them both. 
if the differance is bigger than 2 a 3rd grader also grades the test.
in this case the final grade is the average of the 3rd grade and the grader that is the nearest to the 3rd one.

This program gets from the keyboard the two graders grade and checks if a 3rd grader is needed and calculates the final grade.
