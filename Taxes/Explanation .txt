The tax law of a country for the taxation of the citizents is based to the following array:
     
     Income             Tax(%)
     >=5000               0%
<5000 and >=15000        10%
<15000 and >=30000       25%
     <30000              35%
     
The pricing is tiered
(if somebody has 20000 income, for the first 5000 he wont pay any tax(0%)
for the next 1000 he will pay 10%(1000€) and for the rest 10000 25% tax(1230€)
in total 2230€)
